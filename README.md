## Introduction

The goal of this project is to implement a foundational pipeline for AI-driven music generation. Using the MAESTRO (MIDI and Audio Edited for Synchronous Tracks and Organization) dataset, we aim to preprocess, analyze, and generate music through advanced machine learning techniques.

This repository sets the stage for developing generative models like LSTMs or Transformers to create unique and high-quality music compositions.

## Features

- **MAESTRO Dataset Integration:** Access and preprocess thousands of hours of MIDI and audio data.
- **MIDI File Analysis:** Use PrettyMIDI to parse, visualize, and analyze MIDI files.
- **Audio Generation:** Leverage FluidSynth to synthesize audio from MIDI files.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent results using random seed initialization.

## Dataset

The MAESTRO dataset (v2.0.0) is used in this project. It contains:

- MIDI files
- Corresponding audio files
- Rich metadata for analysis

You can find more details about the dataset [here](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro).

## Installation

To set up the environment and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asadalirasool/AI-Music-.git
   cd AI-Music-
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install FluidSynth (Linux):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install fluidsynth
   ```

4. Install additional Python bindings for FluidSynth:
   ```bash
   pip install pyfluidsynth
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Download the MAESTRO dataset from the [official source](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro).
   - Extract the dataset into a `data` directory.

2. **Run the Preprocessing Script:**
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Analyze MIDI Files:**
   Use PrettyMIDI to visualize and analyze the musical features of the dataset.

4. **Generate Audio:**
   Use FluidSynth to convert MIDI files into audio:
   ```bash
   python generate_audio.py
   ```

## Results

The initial analysis and preprocessing steps provide insights into the datasetâ€™s structure and musical attributes. Future work will involve training advanced models to generate high-quality music compositions.

## Future Work

- Implement generative models like LSTMs and Transformers for music generation.
- Evaluate generated music for creativity and quality.
- Optimize computational efficiency for large-scale datasets.
